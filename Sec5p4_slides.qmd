### :arrows_counterclockwise: From *Sampling Distributions* to the *Sample Mean*

We’ve seen that statistics vary across samples and have their own
**sampling distributions**.

Today, we focus on one statistic in particular: the **sample mean**
$\overline{X}$.

## :speech_balloon: Questions

::: incremental
-   Why is $\overline{X}$ such an important statistic in practice?
-   What do we expect the distribution of $\overline{X}$ to look like?
-   How do shape and sample size affect that distribution?
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## :bar_chart: The Distribution of the Sample Mean {.smaller}

:::: {.callout-note title="Proposition: Distribution of $\\overline{X}$ and $T_0$"}
Let $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ be a random sample from a population with
mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$. Then:

-   $E(\overline{X}) = \mu$
-   $\text{Var}(\overline{X}) = \sigma^2 / n$

::: fragment
For the sample total $T_0 = \sum X_i$

-   $E(T_0) = n\mu$
-   $\text{Var}(T_0) = n\sigma^2$
:::
::::

## :abacus: Special Case: Normal Population

Since a linear combination of independent normal random variables is
also random, it follows that:

:::: {.callout-note title="Proposition: Exact Distribution when $X_i \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma)$"}
If the $X_i$ are i.i.d. from a normal distribution, then for any $n$:

::: incremental
-   $\overline{X} \sim N\left(\mu, \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right)$
-   $T_0 \sim N\left(n\mu, \sqrt{n}\sigma\right)$
:::
::::

## Why is this useful?

-   We can compute **exact** probabilities for $\overline{X}$ or $T_0$
-   Even **small samples** have exact normal sampling distributions

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## :tulip: Example: Hours Spent Outside

Now that it’s spring, suppose the number of hours K students spend
outside per day is normally distributed with:

-   $\mu = 2.5$ hours, $\sigma = 1.2$ hours

A random sample of $n = 16$ students is selected

::: incremental
-   What is the probability the sample mean exceeds 3 hours?

-   Only 1 percent of samples would produce a mean $\bar X$ exceeding
    what value?
:::

::: notes
-   $\overline{X} \sim N\left(2.5, \frac{1.2}{\sqrt{16}}\right) = N(2.5, 0.3)$\
-   $P(\overline{X} > 3)=$
    `1-pnorm(3, 2.5, 1.2/sqrt(16))`$\approx 0.0478$
-   `qnorm(.99, 2.5, 1.2/sqrt(16))` $\approx 3.20$ hours

# Investigation: Who are you texting? {background-color="#E3F2FD"}

## :speech_balloon: Who Are You Texting? {.smaller}

> A researcher is interested in the number of **different people**
> students text on a typical day. A previous study found that the
> **mean** was about **7** and the **standard deviation** was about
> **6**.
>
> Consider a class of 30 students. Each student reports how many
> different people they texted yesterday.

::: incremental
1.  Without seeing any data, **sketch** what you expect the
    **distribution** of this variable to look like.

2.  Suppose we randomly sampled 30 students and computed the **sample
    mean** number of people texted, what shape would you expect the
    **sampling distribution** of the sample mean to have?

::: notes
Ask students to carry out the simulation now.

### :globe_with_meridians: Approximation: Central Limit Theorem {.smaller}

:::: {.callout-note title="Theorem: Central Limit Theorem (CLT)"}
Let $X_1, \dots, X_n$ be i.i.d. from a population with mean $\mu$ and
variance $\sigma^2$. Then, as $n \to \infty$:

$$
\frac{\overline{X} - \mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}} \to N(0,1)
$$

::: fragment
Equivalently:

$$
\overline{X} \dot{\sim} N\left(\mu, \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right)
$$
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------


## :iphone: Example: People Texted Per Day

Let $X$ = number of different people a student texts in a day. Assume:

-   $\mu = 7$, $\sigma = 6$

-   $n = 40$ students

**Q:** Approximate the probability that mean exceeds 8 people:
$P(\overline{X} > 8)$

::: notes
-   $\overline{X} \dot{\sim} N(7, 6/\sqrt{40}) = N(7, 0.95)$\
-   $P(\overline{X} > 8) \approx 0.1469$\
:::


------------------------------------------------------------------------

## :warning: Notes on Using the CLT

::: incremental
-   Works well even when population is not normal
-   Accuracy improves with $n$
-   The approximation is usually good if $n > 30$ unless the population
    is extremely skewed.
-   Check skewness/heavy tails before applying
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## :memo: Summary: Sample Mean Distributions

-   $\overline{X}$ is unbiased for $\mu$; SD shrinks as $n$ increases\
-   If population is normal, $\overline{X}$ is exactly normal\
-   If population is arbitrary, $\overline{X}$ is **approximately
    normal** for large $n$

:::{.fragment}
:point_right: CLT is an amazing result — it helps us use normal-based
methods even when data aren’t normal!
