## The Key Idea of Regression {.smaller}

::: callout-note
**DB:** “The key idea in developing a probabilistic relationship between a **dependent** or **response** variable $y$ and an **independent**, **explanatory**, or **predictor** variable $x$ is to realize that once the value of $x$ has been fixed, there is still uncertainty in what the resulting $y$ value will be.”
:::

We seek to characterize the distribution of the random variable $Y$ given $x$.

**Model:**

$$
Y = f(x) + \epsilon
$$

---

## The Simple Linear Model

We focus on linear models of the form:

$$
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon
$$

::: callout-important
Where:
- $\epsilon \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$
- $\epsilon$'s are independent
- Each $(x_i, y_i)$ pair is a realization from this model
:::

We aim to estimate $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$, and $\sigma^2$ from the data.

---

## A Linear Probabilistic Model

Instead of a deterministic relationship, we assume:

> The **expected value** of $Y$ is a linear function of $x$:

$$
E(Y | x) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x
$$

And the observed $Y$ deviates from this expected value due to random error $\epsilon$.

---

## Estimating Model Parameters

We use the **method of least squares**:

$$
\hat{\beta}_0, \hat{\beta}_1 = \arg\min_{b_0, b_1} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - b_0 - b_1 x_i)^2
$$

This gives us the **estimated regression line**:

$$
\hat{y} = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x
$$

---

## Least Squares Estimates

::: callout-note
**Formulas:**

$$
\hat{\beta}_1 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2} = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}}, \quad \hat{\beta}_0 = \bar{y} - \hat{\beta}_1 \bar{x}
$$
:::

Under the assumption $\epsilon \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$, these are also **maximum likelihood estimates**.

## Example: Swirling Time vs Distance

🧪 From the student funnel lab: use `distance` to predict `time`.

**Variables:**
- $x$ = distance up the channel (cm)
- $y$ = swirling time (sec)

Leave space to compute estimates on canvas.

```r
lm_fit <- lm(time ~ distance, data = funnel_data)
summary(lm_fit)
plot(time ~ distance, data = funnel_data)
abline(lm_fit)
```

---

## Interpreting Output in R

```r
summary(lm_fit)
```

Includes:
- Estimates $\hat{\beta}_0$, $\hat{\beta}_1$
- Standard errors
- t-values and p-values
- $R^2$

```r
anova(lm_fit)
```

Used to test overall model fit (F-test).

---

## Example: Purrfect Prediction? 🐾

🐱 Predict `weight` of cats based on `height` using `MASS::cats`

```r
library(MASS)
lm_cats <- lm(Bwt ~ Hwt, data = cats)
summary(lm_cats)
plot(Bwt ~ Hwt, data = cats)
abline(lm_cats)
```

What does \$\hat\{\beta\}_1\$ tell us about how height affects weight?

---

## Estimating $\sigma^2$ and $\sigma$

**Error sum of squares (SSE):**

$$
\text{SSE} = \sum (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
$$

**Estimate of variance:**

$$
\hat{\sigma}^2 = \frac{\text{SSE}}{n - 2}
$$

Used for inference and standard errors of slope/intercept.

---

## Coefficient of Determination $R^2$

> Measures proportion of variance in $y$ explained by $x$.

$$
R^2 = 1 - \frac{\text{SSE}}{\text{SST}}, \quad \text{SST} = \sum (y_i - \bar{y})^2
$$

::: callout-warning
Beware! A high $R^2$ does **not** imply causation or even a good model fit beyond the range of data.
:::

## Regression Cautions

- 📉 **Plot the data** before fitting the model.
- 🚧 **Extrapolation is risky** — don't predict far outside the data range.
- 🎯 Model assumptions: Linearity, constant variance, independence, normality.

---

## Summary

- Simple linear regression models $E(Y|x) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x$
- Parameters estimated via **least squares**
- Variability estimated via residual sum of squares (SSE)
- $R^2$ quantifies model fit
- Use `lm()`, `summary()`, and `anova()` in R to implement
