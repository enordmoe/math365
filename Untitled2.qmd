## Definition: Sample Median {.smaller}

**The _sample median_** is obtained by first ordering the $n$ observations from smallest to largest  
(with any repeated values included so that every sample observation appears in the ordered list).

. . . 

Then,

$$
\tilde{x} =
\begin{cases}
\text{The single middle value if $n$ is odd} & = \left( \frac{n+1}{2} \right)^\text{th} \text{ ordered value} \\
\text{The average of the two middle values if $n$ is even} & = \text{average of } \left( \frac{n}{2} \right)^\text{th} \text{ and } \left( \frac{n}{2} + 1 \right)^\text{th} \text{ ordered values}
\end{cases}
$$
