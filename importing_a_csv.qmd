## Importing Data from Google Sheets into RStudio

After you have recorded your funnel experiment data in a Google Sheet, follow these steps to export it as a `.csv` file and load it into RStudio using the graphical interface.

### Step 1: Export as `.csv` from Google Sheets

1.  In your Google Sheet, go to the menu bar.
2.  Click **File ➝ Download ➝ Comma-separated values (.csv, current sheet)**.
3.  This will download a file named something like `funneldata.csv` to your Downloads folder.

### Step 2: Open RStudio and Import the CSV File

1.  In RStudio, locate the **Environment** tab (top-right panel by default).
2.  Click on **Import Dataset ➝ From Text (base)...**
3.  In the pop-up:
    -   Click **Browse** and navigate to the location where you saved the `.csv` file.
    -   Make sure **Heading = Yes** (if your Google Sheet has column headers).
    -   Preview the data and make sure it looks correct.
4.  Click **Import**.

RStudio will:

-   Load your data into a data frame (usually named `funneldata` by default),
-   And display the R command it used to do so in the Console.

The command on the Console will look something like this:

``` r
funneldata <- read.csv("path/to/your/funneldata.csv")
```

### Step 3: Copy the Import Command into Your Quarto Document

To ensure your analysis is fully reproducible, copy the `read.csv()` line that appeared in the Console into your Quarto document, usually in the first code chunk after setup:

``` r
funneldata <- read.csv("funneldata.csv")
```

> Tip: You may want to move the `.csv` file into the same folder as your `.qmd` file to simplify the file path.
