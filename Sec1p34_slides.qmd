### Warm-Up: What Value of $c$ Minimizes Squared Deviations?

We will investigate:  
$$
S(c) = \sum_{i=1}^3 (x_i - c)^2 \quad \text{for } x_1 = 4,\ x_2 = 7,\ x_3 = 10
$$

---

### Warm-Up

1. Choose a value for $c$ (e.g., $5,\ 6,\ 7,\ 8$). Compute $S(c) = (x_1 - c)^2 + (x_2 - c)^2 + (x_3 - c)^2$. 
<span class="fragment">What do you notice?</span>

2. <span class="fragment">Try to guess the value of $c$ that minimizes $S(c)$. Why does that value make sense?</span>

3. <span class="fragment">Optional extension: Expand and simplify $S(c)$ algebraically. Can you take its derivative?</span>

4. <span class="fragment">What do you think this says about the mean as a "best" measure of center?</span>






## Summarizing Data

::: incremental
-   Describe the distribution or pattern of variability of a variable
-   Data cleaning/editing
-   Uncover patterns and/or anomalies
-   Compare two or more distributions
:::

## Data Set: General Social Survey 2018

-   Begun in 1972, the **General Social Survey (GSS)** is a long-running
    longitudinal survey conducted annually that gathers data on the
    attitudes, behaviors, and demographics of US adults.

-   The surveys are conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago and
    track a wide range of topics including politics, religion, work, and
    social life.

-   The dataset **GSS2018** from the R package **resampledata3**
    contains a subset of the data from 2018.

```{r}
#install.packages("resampledata3")
library(resampledata3)
names(GSS2018)
```

## Summarizing Categorical Data

::: incremental
-   A **relative frequency** table displays the values assumed by the
    variable in a sample of data.
-   A **bar chart** is just a graphical summary of a frequency
    table
:::

## Describing the GSS2018 Data

### Frequency Table

```{r}
summary(GSS2018$GenderNow) # first few values
table(GSS2018$GenderNow)  # Frequency table (but not too pretty)
```

::: callout-note
## Finding NAs

Note that the default `table()` command does not show NA values but
`summary()` does.

### Relative Frequency Table and Adding Totals

```{r}
prop.table(table(GSS2018$GenderNow))

# Frequency table with totals
addmargins(table(GSS2018$GenderNow))

# Relative frequency table with totals
addmargins(prop.table(table(GSS2018$GenderNow)))

```


## Gender Identity Bar Charts

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Frequency Plot

```{r}
barplot(table(GSS2018$GenderNow))
```

### Relative Frequency Plot

```{r}
barplot(prop.table(table(GSS2018$GenderNow)), ylab = "proportion")
```

### Plot Percents

```{r}
barplot(100*prop.table(table(GSS2018$GenderNow)), ylab = "Percent")
```

## Warm-Up: What Value of $c$ Minimizes Squared Deviations?

Weâ€™ll investigate:  
$$
S(c) = \sum_{i=1}^3 (x_i - c)^2 \quad \text{for } x_1 = 4,\ x_2 = 7,\ x_3 = 10
$$

---

### Instructions

1. Choose a few values for $c$ (e.g., $5,\ 6,\ 7,\ 8$).  
   Compute $S(c) = (x_1 - c)^2 + (x_2 - c)^2 + (x_3 - c)^2$ 
   
   :::{.fragment}
   What do you notice? Which $c$ gives the smallest total?
   :::

2. ::: {.fragment}
   Guess the value of $c$ that minimizes $S(c)$. Why does that make sense?
   :::

3. ::: {.fragment}
   Optional extension: Expand $S(c)$ algebraically. Can you take its derivative?

4. ::: {.fragment}
   What does this say about the mean as a "best" measure of center?
