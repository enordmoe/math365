Perfect—thanks for sharing the content. Based on your Quarto slides on **Section 1.3: Experiments and Observational Studies**, here are a few class warm-up discussions to reinforce and apply these concepts in an engaging way:

---

### 🎯 **Quick Review Discussions for Section 1.3**

#### 💬 **Discussion 1: Ice Cream and Drowning?!**
**Prompt:**  
*“More ice cream sales are linked to more deaths by drowning.”*  
What’s going on here? Can we say ice cream causes drowning? Why or why not?

**Goal:** Get students to explain confounding and clarify the difference between association and causation.

---

#### 🧠 **Discussion 2: Observational or Experimental?**
**Prompt:**  
You read a study: “Children who take music lessons tend to score higher on math tests.”  
Is this an observational study or an experiment? Could you design an experiment to test this claim?

**Goal:** Practice identifying study types and thinking about control, randomization, and feasibility.

---

#### 🧪 **Randomize It!**
**Prompt:**  
Imagine you want to test whether standing desks improve focus. How would you design a randomized experiment?

**Bonus:** “What’s the role of a placebo or a control group in this case?”

**Goal:** Reinforce experimental design principles: randomization, control, replication.

---

#### **Matched Pairs in Action**
**Prompt:**  
Two new energy drinks claim to improve reaction time. You want to compare them using a matched pairs design. What could that look like?

**Follow-up:** "What’s an advantage of using a matched pairs design here?"

**Goal:** Solidify understanding of matched pairs design with real-world application.

Would you like me to format these as in-class slides or a printable discussion handout for students to write on?
