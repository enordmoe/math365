## Basic Summary Functions

These base R functions provide quick ways to summarize numeric data. We'll use `mtcars$mpg` (miles per gallon) as our example:

```r
x <- mtcars$mpg
```

### `mean()` â€“ Arithmetic Average
```r
mean(x)  # Average value
```

### `sd()` â€“ Standard Deviation
```r
sd(x)    # Measure of typical distance from the mean
```

### `range()` â€“ Minimum and Maximum
```r
range(x)           # Returns a vector: c(min, max)
diff(range(x))     # Computes the range as a single number
```

### `summary()` â€“ Five-Number Summary + Mean
```r
summary(x)  # Min, 1st Qu., Median, Mean, 3rd Qu., Max
```

### `fivenum()` â€“ Tukey's Five-Number Summary
```r
fivenum(x)  # Min, Lower Hinge, Median, Upper Hinge, Max
```

### `mean(..., trim = ...)` â€“ Trimmed Mean
```r
mean(x, trim = 0.1)  # Trimmed mean after removing 10% from each end
```
- Useful when you want a **robust average** thatâ€™s less affected by outliers
- Common choices: 5%, 10%, or 20% trimming depending on context

## Visual Summary: `boxplot()`

```r
boxplot(x, main = "Boxplot of mtcars$mpg")
```

- The box shows the **hinges** (Tukey's lower and upper fourths) and the **median**.
- Whiskers extend to min and max (or only to non-outliers, depending on method).

## Computing the Hinges and Fourth Spread

The output from `fivenum()` gives:

```r
f <- fivenum(x)
f
```

This returns:
- $f_1$ = minimum
- $f_2$ = lower hinge (approx. 1st quartile)
- $f_3$ = median
- $f_4$ = upper hinge (approx. 3rd quartile)
- $f_5$ = maximum

### Hinges and Fourth Spread

```r
lower_hinge <- f[2]  # Lower fourth / hinge
upper_hinge <- f[4]  # Upper fourth / hinge

fourth_spread <- upper_hinge - lower_hinge
fourth_spread
```

This value represents the **spread of the middle half** of the data and is robust to outliers.

## Try It Yourself ðŸ‘‰

- Replace `x` with another variable like `mtcars$hp`.
- Compare `fivenum()` vs. `summary()` â€” how do the hinges differ from quartiles?
- Try a trimmed mean: `mean(x, trim = 0.1)`.
- Compute `1.5 * fourth_spread` to identify mild outliers using the **Tukey rule**.
