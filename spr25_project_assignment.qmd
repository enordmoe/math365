# Estimating a Parameter

**Proposal Due:** Friday, May 9, 2025  
**Presentation Due:** Friday, June 6, 2025

## Introduction

In this group project, you will estimate an unknown parameter using real-world data. This project is intended to strengthen your understanding of the process of statistical analysis from conception to presentation, using classical statistical methods supported by empirical investigation via R.

The final output will be a  Quarto **slide presentation** (rendered as HTML) for the project submission, but this assignment description is presented here as a Quarto document.

You will work in groups of **2-3 students** (your choice).

## Project Overview

Expectations:

- Identify an unknown parameter to estimate.
- Select and justify an estimator using classical techniques we have studied.
- Gather real-world data through experimental or observational methods (no surveys).
- Apply R to explore the sampling behavior of your estimator empirically (via simulation or resampling).
- Analyze your data to obtain your estimate and confidence interval.
- Create a Quarto slide presentation that communicates your findings clearly and rigorously.

**Focus:** Mastery of estimation theory and clear communication of statistical reasoning.

## Detailed Project Steps

### Choosing the Parameter and Estimator

- Choose a parameter such as:
  - Mean, variance, or proportion
  - Difference of means or proportions
  - Ratio of means or variances
  - Relative risk
  - Regression slope
- Select an appropriate classical estimator (method of moments, MLE, or others).

### Data Collection

- Prefer original experimental or observational data collection.
- Sample size of at least 50 observations.
- If using existing web datasets, you must obtain prior approval.
- No data collection by surveys! It's too difficulty to do a good job of this.

### Empirical Investigation

- Use R to:
  - Visualize and summarize your collected data.
  - Simulate the sampling distribution of your estimator (if appropriate).
  - Use resampling (e.g., bootstrapping) to explore the variability of your estimator, and discuss whether the empirical behavior aligns with theoretical expectations (e.g., approximate normality, standard error formulas).

### Analytical Work

- Derive or explain your chosen estimator analytically.
- Discuss assumptions and verify them where feasible.
- Provide full calculations for your point estimate and a confidence interval.

## Components of the Final Presentation

### Background
- Define the parameter.
- Provide context for why the parameter and data are of interest.

### Supporting Statistical Theory
- Clearly state assumptions.
- Derive or explain your estimator (method of moments, MLE, etc.).
- Discuss properties: unbiasedness, variance, mean squared error.

### Data Collection
- Describe how data were collected.
- Identify the population, sample, and potential biases.

### Results and Exploratory Data Analysis
- Provide numerical and graphical summaries.
- Investigate distributional assumptions.

### Calculations
- Show how the estimator was computed.
- Construct and interpret a confidence interval.

### Empirical Investigation in R
- Show how you used R to examine the estimator's properties.
- Include relevant code and plots.

### Conclusions
- Interpret your results.
- Discuss limitations and future directions.

### Appendix
- Upload your data and any additional materials separately to Moodle.

## Grading

- **Proposal (20 points):** One paragraph describing your plan, due May 9.
- **Final Project (80 points):** Graded for:
  - Depth and rigor of analysis
  - Correctness and clarity
  - Quality and professionalism of the Quarto slide presentation
  - Empirical investigation of properties (using R)


## Final Note

**Your Quarto slide presentation is a key part of demonstrating your mastery.**

It should:  
- Be organized, logical, and clear.  
- Integrate clear mathematical exposition with thoughtful R-based exploration.  
- Reflect your deep understanding of statistical estimation.  

I will provide a template and Quarto resources to help you!  

## Appendix: Suggested Project Ideas

Here are some ideas for parameters you might estimate:

### Single-Sample Estimates
- Mean tensile strength of a 3D printed material
- Variance of reaction times in a computer task
- Proportion of defective items in a manufacturing process

### Two-Sample Comparisons
- Difference in mean growth rates of plants under two fertilizers
- Difference in proportions of success under two treatments
- Ratio of variances for two measurement devices

### Regression Settings
- Slope of a simple linear regression (e.g., height vs. wingspan)

### Other Creative Ideas
- Estimating a rate parameter for a Poisson process (e.g., arrival of buses)
- Estimating the exponential rate parameter from waiting times (e.g., website (Moodle!) load times)
- Estimating reliability parameters from real-world engineering data

When in doubt, ask!
