# Overview

This review sheet outlines key concepts, definitions, and skills covered so far. It includes summaries of core ideas, terminology, and sample problems. Refer back to lesson notes, homework problems, and R output for more examples and visualizations.

## Exam Logistics

-   Date/Time: Friday: April 25, 8 am (you can start before 8:15 if you prefer extra time)\
-   Allowable resources:
    -   8.5x11 single-sided notes page
    -   Calculator
    -   Computer: You may be asked to use R for probability calculations (e.g., `pnorm()`) but will not be asked to carry out data analysis or simulations.

# Topics and Concepts

## 1. Populations, Samples, and Statistical Studies

-   **Population**: Group about which we want to make inference.
-   **Sample**: Subset of the population used for analysis.
-   **Descriptive statistics**: Graphical and numerical summaries.
-   **Inferential statistics**: Use probability to draw conclusions about a population.
-   **Enumerative vs Analytic Studies**:
    -   *Enumerative*: Study fixed populations.
    -   *Analytic*: Concerned with future performance (e.g., processes).

## 2. Data Collection and Sampling

-   **Simple Random Sample (SRS)**: Every group of size $n$ equally likely.
-   **Stratified Sampling**: Sample within homogeneous subgroups.
-   **Convenience Sampling**: Non-random and often biased.
-   **Designed Experiments** vs **Observational Studies**: Unlike observational studies, where researchers observe without intervention, designed experiments involve actively assigning treatments to assess causal effects.

## 3. Types and Summaries of Data

-   **Categorical Variables**: Summarized by frequency tables and bar charts.
-   **Quantitative Variables**:
    -   *Continuous*: e.g., height, cholesterol level
    -   *Discrete*: e.g., number of siblings

### Summary Statistics for Quantitative Data

-   **Center**: Mean, median, trimmed mean\
-   **Spread**: Range, standard deviation, fourth spread\
-   **Shape**: Symmetry, skewness, modality\
-   **Outliers**: Flagged using the fourth spread
    -   values more than $1.5 \times f_s$ beyond the hinges are **mild outliers**
    -   more than $3 \times f_s$ are **extreme outliers**\
-   **Visual Tools**: Dotplots (stripcharts), histograms, boxplots


------------------------------------------------------------------------


## 4. Statistics and Their Distributions

-   **Statistic**: A random variable based on a sample (e.g., $\bar{X}$, $\hat{p}$)
-   **Sampling Distribution**: The probability distribution of a statistic across all possible samples.
-   **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**: $$
    \bar{X} \dot{\sim} N\left(\mu, \frac{\sigma^2}{n}\right) \quad \text{for large } n
    $$
-   **Simulation**: Used to approximate sampling distributions when exact derivation is infeasible.

## 5. Properties of Estimators

-   **Unbiasedness**: $E(\hat{\theta}) = \theta$
-   **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: $$
    \text{MSE}(\hat{\theta}) = \text{Var}(\hat{\theta}) + [\text{Bias}(\hat{\theta})]^2
    $$
-   **MVUE**: Minimum variance among all unbiased estimators
-   **Standard Error (SE)**: $\sqrt{\text{Var}(\hat{\theta})}$

## 6. Bootstrap Methods

-   **Parametric Bootstrap**: Simulate new samples from a fitted model to estimate SE.

## 7. Estimation Techniques

-   **Method of Moments (MoM)**: Match sample and population moments to solve for parameter estimates.

-   **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)**:

    -   Maximize $L(\theta) = f(x_1, \dots, x_n; \theta)$
    -   Use log-likelihood: $\ell(\theta) = \log L(\theta)$
    -   Properties: invariant under transformation, consistent, often MVUE

# Practice Problems

## Problem 1: Sampling and Inference

Suppose you are studying the amount of sugar in breakfast cereals sold in the U.S. in 2023.

-   Is this an enumerative or analytic study?
-   Identify the population, sample, and variable.
-   Suggest a suitable sampling method. Discuss its strengths and weaknesses.

## Problem 2: Distribution of Sample Mean

Let $X$ be the time (in minutes) K students wait for coffee at the Book Club, with $\mu = 4$, $\sigma = 1.5$. Let $\bar{X}$ be the mean of a sample of $n = 36$.

-   Use the CLT to approximate $P(\bar{X} > 4.5)$.
-   What is the 95th percentile of the sampling distribution of $\bar{X}$?

## Problem 3: Interpreting R Output

You are given the following R commands and output based on the `mtcars` dataset:

``` r
tapply(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$cyl, mean)
boxplot(mpg ~ cyl, data = mtcars)
hist(mtcars$mpg)
```

-   Explain what each command does and what you would expect the output to show.
-   What types of conclusions could be drawn from this output?
-   What features would you examine to assess center, spread, or shape?

## Problem 4: Estimator Properties

Let $\hat{p} = X/n$ be the sample proportion from a binomial distribution with parameter $p$.

-   Show that $E(\hat{p}) = p$.
-   Compute $\text{Var}(\hat{p})$.
-   Is $\hat{p}$ the MVUE for $p$?

## Problem 5: MLE for Geometric Distribution

Suppose $X_1, \dots, X_n$ are i.i.d. from the geometric distribution with PMF: $$
P(X = x) = (1 - p)^{x - 1}p, \quad x = 1, 2, \dots,\ 0 < p < 1
$$

-   Write the likelihood function $L(p)$ and the log-likelihood $\ell(p)$.
-   Find the value of $p$ that maximizes the likelihood.
-   Compare to the method of moments estimator.
