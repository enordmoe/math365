## :bar_chart: Statistics

::: {.callout-note title="Definition: Statistic"}
A **statistic** is any quantity whose value can be calculated from
sample data. A statistic is a **random variable**, and will be denoted
by an *uppercase letter* (e.g., $\bar X$); a *lowercase letter* (e.g.,
$\bar x$) represents an observed or calculated value of the statistic.

::: notes
Generally, statistics are computed to estimate a population parameter

## :bar_chart: Sampling Distributions

::: {.callout-note title="Definition: Sampling Distribution"}
The **probability distribution** of a statistic is often called its
**sampling distribution**, to emphasize that it describes how the
statistic varies across all possible samples.

## :school: Estimating Faculty Years of Service

Suppose we're interested in estimating the **average number of years**
faculty have served in the **Math Department** at Kalamazoo College.

-   Think about how to describe how a **statistic** (like the sample
    mean) varies across different samples\

## :coffee: K Coffee Habits {.smaller}

At Kalamazoo College, suppose about **30% of students** buy coffee on
campus at least once a week. Suppose you **randomly sample 10
students**.

Let:

-   $X$ = number of students in the sample who buy coffee weekly

-   $\hat{p} = X/10$ = sample proportion

**Questions:**

::: incremental
-   What kind of random variable is $X$?

-   What values can $\hat{p}$ take?

-   What is the sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$?

-   What is the probability that 20% of the students in our sample buy
    coffee weekly?

## 🎲 Simulation and Sampling Distributions

*  When a derivation via probability rules is very difficult or even impossible,  we can use **simulation** to approximate the **sampling distribution** of a statistic.  

* Simulate the sampling distribution of a statistic by drawing from a known population many times and calculating the values of the statistic of interest (e.g., trimmed mean)

## 📝 Summary: Statistics and Their Distributions {.smaller}

- A **statistic** is a quantity computed from sample data — it is a random variable  
- The **sampling distribution** describes how a statistic varies across all possible samples

- We can explore sampling distributions:
  - 🔢 By enumeration (all possible samples)
  - 🧮 Analytically (using probability)
  - 🎲 Through simulation (approximating variability empirically)


> Understanding how statistics behave across samples is **fundamental to inference.**
