## Summarizing Data

::: incremental
-   Describe the distribution or pattern of variability of a variable
-   Data cleaning/editing
-   Uncover patterns and/or anomalies
-   Compare two or more distributions
:::

# Categorical Data {background-color="#E8F5E9"}

## Data Set: General Social Survey 2018

-   Begun in 1972, the **General Social Survey (GSS)** is a long-running
    longitudinal survey conducted annually that gathers data on the
    attitudes, behaviors, and demographics of US adults.

-   The surveys are conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago and
    track a wide range of topics including politics, religion, work, and
    social life.

-   The dataset **GSS2018** from the R package **resampledata3**
    contains a subset of the data from 2018.

## The GSS2018 Dataset

![](images/clipboard-1844474087.png){width="250"}

```{r}
#install.packages("resampledata3")
library(resampledata3)
names(GSS2018)
```

## Visualizing Categorical Data

Most common methods: ::: incremental - A **relative frequency** table
displays the values assumed by the variable in a sample of data. - A
**bar chart** is just a graphical summary of a frequency table :::

::: notes
-   Avoid pie charts- hard to estimate values
:::

## Describing the GSS2018 Data

### Frequency Table

```{r}
summary(GSS2018$GenderNow) # first few values
table(GSS2018$GenderNow)  # Frequency table (but not too pretty)
```

::: callout-note
## Finding NAs

Note that the default `table()` command does not show NA values but
`summary()` does.
:::

### Relative Frequency Table and Adding Totals

```{r}
prop.table(table(GSS2018$GenderNow))

# Frequency table with totals
addmargins(table(GSS2018$GenderNow))

# Relative frequency table with totals
addmargins(prop.table(table(GSS2018$GenderNow)))

```

## Gender Identity Bar Charts

::: panel-tabset
### Frequency Plot

```{r}
barplot(table(GSS2018$GenderNow))
```

### Relative Frequency Plot

```{r}
barplot(prop.table(table(GSS2018$GenderNow)), ylab = "proportion")
```

### Plot Percents

```{r}
barplot(100*prop.table(table(GSS2018$GenderNow)), ylab = "Percent")
```

# Quantitative data {background-color="#E8F5E9"}

## Examples of Quantitative Variables {.smaller}

::: incremental
-   **Quantitative** variables are inherently numerical:
    -   **Continuous variables** take values on a continuous scale:
        -   Height

        -   Cholesterol

        -   Time to complete a marathon

        -   Rates and proportions
    -   **Discrete** variables are quantitative variables that are **not
        continuous**
        -   Number of siblings

        -   Number of defects in a product

        -   Age reported in years

        -   Number of available parking spaces

        -   Number of cigarettes smoked per day
:::

## Summarizing Quantitative Data

Visual displays of quantitative data depict

-   Overall pattern

    -   Center

    -   Spread

    -   Shape: symmetric, skewed, bimodal, multi-modal

-   Outliers

# A built-in R dataset

**mtcars** contains Motor Trend published data on 32 automobiles
(1973-74 models).

```{r}
mtcars
```

# Dotplots

::: panel-tabset
## Number of Cylinders

```{r}
stripchart(mtcars$cyl, method = "stack", xlab = "Number of cylinders")

```

## Mileage

```{r}
stripchart(mtcars$mpg, method = "stack", xlab = "Mileage")
```
:::

# Dotplots Summary

::: incremental
-   Useful quick summary

-   Good, summary for small datasets with discrete data

-   Continuous data results in overlapping points and/or grouping of
    observations

-   Many ways to do this in R but none are great
:::

## Histograms: R default

::: panel-tabset
## Cylinders

```{r}
hist(mtcars$cyl, xlab = "Number of cylinders")
```

## Cylinders v2.0

```{r}
# Manually set intervals: (3.5, 4.5], (4.5, 5.5],...
hist(mtcars$cyl, breaks = seq(3.5, 8.5, 1),xlab = "Number of cylinders")
```

## Mileage

```{r}
hist(mtcars$mpg, xlab = "Mileage")
```
:::

## Histograms Using Density

-   Technically, histograms are carefully designed to represent relative
    frequency by area plotting density on the vertical scale so that the
    total area in the rectangles sums to 1.
-   Define:

$$
\text{Rectangle Height}=\frac{\text{Relative frequency}}{\text{Class width}}
$$

-   This avoids misrepresenting the shape of the distribution,
    especially when using unequal widths.

## Histograms: Density as Height {.smaller}

::: panel-tabset
## Mileage

R plots density as height when intervals are unequal width

```{r}
#| fig-height: 3
hist(mtcars$mpg, xlab = "Mileage", breaks = c(10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 35))
```

## Mileage: INCORRECT

Plotting frequencies here would be misleading and R warns you about
this.

```{r}
#| fig-height: 3
hist(mtcars$mpg, xlab = "Mileage", breaks = c(10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 35),
     freq = TRUE)
```

## Histogram Shapes

Shapes to look out for when working with distributions of quantitative
variables:\

## 

## Practice on your own   {.smaller}

1.  Copy and paste the following code to your R console to read the
    Example 1.8 data into a data frame called **gradrates**.

```{r}
 gradrates <- read.csv("http://people.kzoo.edu/enordmoe/math365/data/exp01-08.csv")
```

2.  Use the `View()` function at the console to inspect the data. What
    is the name of the variable representing the percent of the state's
    population that have a college degree?
3.   Use `stripchart()` to obtain a dotplot like the one in Figure 1.6.
    How is it similar and how is it different?
4.  Obtain three histograms of college degree percent
    i.  Equal width intervals and frequency as height
    ii. Equal width intervals and density as height
    iii. Unequal width intervals and density as height

## More practice: **faithful**  {.smaller}

1.  Type **?faithful** at the console to learn about the built-in
    **faithful** datset
2.  Use the graphs from this section to explore the varibles *eruptions*
    and *waiting*.
3.  How would you describe the shapes of the distributions?
4.  Which graphs are most useful for this data?
5.  You can get a smoothed version of a histogram called a density plot
    using the basic command `plot(density(df$var))` where `df`
    represents the data frame name and `var` is the variable. Try this
    with either variable. (Try changing `n` and `bw` if you're
    adventurous.)
